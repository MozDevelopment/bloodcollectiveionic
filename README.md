"Blood Collective"

About Project: 
This prototype has been made during the "MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop 2015". Bloodcollective is a community driven blood donation network.

Mentors: Alexis Hope, Sands Fish, Rahul Bhargava 

Problem : In  India when you need blood there is very rare chance that you will get blood when you need it. The second problem is that some people do not want to donate the blood and people who donate the blood are frustrated with the criteria of blood banks.

So our "Bloodcollective" solve this problem by geo locating the donor and receiver in the real time.

Technology Used:
Ionic Framwork, Angular JS, Apache Cordova.

This project is in still development.
